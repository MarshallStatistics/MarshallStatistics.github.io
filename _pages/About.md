Hi! Thanks for taking a look at my GitHub site! My name is Daniel Marshall and I am a PhD Researcher at Brunel, University of London, exploring the consequences of combining network science with experimental design theory. 

## Background

I have an integrated masters degree in Mathematics from the University of York, a Postgraduate Certificate of Education from the University of Hull, and a further MSc in Mathematics from Queen Mary, University of London. 

## Skills

- Programming languages: Python, C++
- Data analysis: Python, Excel

## Projects

- MSc Research Methods Presentation: A 10-minute LaTeX/Beamer presentation discussing the Paradox of the Pesticides; an interesting result one observes when introducing pesticide to a system of Lotka-Volterra equations. I used Python to visualise this result and provide animations in the presentation. 
- MSc Thesis: An analysis of sea turtle foraging patterns alongside a discussion of the hierarchy of stochastic processes. I used quantile-quantile plots, log-log plots, semi-log plots, and simple fits to determine to what extent the foraging patterns adhered to the theory of Brownian motion.
