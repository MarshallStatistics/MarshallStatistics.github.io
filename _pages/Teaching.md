I am grateful to have had the opportunity to teach a wide array of students across different disciplines and levels of study. Please see specifics below.

## Secondary and Further Education

I have four years experience teaching A-Level and GCSE courses. In that time, I have taught:
- OCR Level 2 Functional Skills
- Edexcel GCSE Mathematics (Higher and Foundation)
- Edexcel A-Level Further Mathematics
- OCR A-Level Further Mathematics
- OCR A-Level Mathematics
- OCR A-Level Engineering

### A-Level and GCSE Mathematics Teaching Resources

I have taught a wide array of students and strived to support them with differentiated resources. 

Please see the A-Level and GCSE Mathematics resources I have uploaded to TES [here](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resources/shop/DannyCMarshall).

## Higher Education

I also have experience teaching in a Higher Education institution, teaching Level 3 Numeracy and Business Studies courses. Specifically, I have taught the following modules at Arden University:
- Academic Skills Practice
- Developing your Academic Skills
- Exploring the Business Environment
- Introduction to Research Skills
- Introduction to Numeracy, Data & IT
- Psychology of Everyday Life
- Structure of Business
- Technology in Organisations
- Values, Ethics, and Working Collaboratively

I was also module leader over two years for an Introduction to Numeracy, Data & IT and Using Numeracy, Data & IT. These were introductory modules on mathematics and basic data analysis, preparing students for their future courses.

I am a fellow of the HEA, in recognition of my dedication toward quality learning and teaching.{: .notice}
