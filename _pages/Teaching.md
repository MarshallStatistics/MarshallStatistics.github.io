I have four years experience teaching A-Level and GCSE Mathematics. In that time, I have taught:
- OCR Level 2 Functional Skills
- Edexcel GCSE Mathematics (Higher and Foundation)
- Edexcel A-Level Further Mathematics
- OCR A-Level Further Mathematics
- OCR A-Level Mathematics

I also have experience teaching in a Higher Education institution, teaching Level 3 Numeracy and Business Studies courses. Moreover, I am a fellow of the HEA, in recognition of my dedication toward quality learning and teaching. 

## A-Level and GCSE Mathematics Teaching Resources

I have taught a wide array of students and strived to support them with differentiated resources. 

Please see the A-Level and GCSE Mathematics resources I have uploaded to TES [here](https://www.tes.com/teaching-resources/shop/DannyCMarshall).
