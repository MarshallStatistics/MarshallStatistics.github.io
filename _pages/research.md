Please see below my various undergraduate and postgraduate academic projects in reverse chronological order.

## MSc thesis, *Queen Mary, University of London* (2023/2024)

MSc thesis supervised by Dr Rainer Klages. Abstract below:

 > The statistical analysis of marine life foraging patterns is of contemporary significance, in view of the global pursuit to conserve oceanic biodiversity. This thesis seeks to understand sea turtle foraging patterns by applying the theory of Brownian motion to empirical data. Firstly, we explore a hierarchy of stochastic processes, ranging from the simple random walk to Langevin dynamics, in order to motivate the statistical analysis. The established theory is then applied to satellite telemetry data of three loggerhead sea turtles, foraging off the coast of West Africa. The data analysis revealed that the turtle foraging patterns do not strictly obey the theory of Brownian motion, shedding light on the complexity of animal movement.

## MSc presentation, *Queen Mary, University of London* (2023/2024)

MSc presentation as part of the Research Methods module of the MSc. Abstract below:

 > The Lotka-Volterra equations describe the coupled interaction between predator and prey population densities. This five-minute presentation explores the mathematics behind the 'Paradox of the Pesticides', a phenomenon that describes the perceived loss of prey density when pesticides are introduced to a two-species system.

## Action Research Report, *Centre for Excellence in Mathematics* (2020/2021)

An action research project to assess the impact that tutor feedback tone can have on students' motivation to study mathematics. Abstract below:

 > In this manuscript, we evaluate the efficacy of providing students with formative and summative assessment feedback of various tones. By contrasting student reactions to a variety of feedback, we aim to enlighten UK-based educators across the Further Education sector on the optimal approach to authoring assessment feedback to improve learners’ engagement and conscientiousness. In a perpetually changing educational landscape, we were particularly interested in teachers’ opinions of feedback and to assess whether attitudes are changing toward more traditional forms of feedback. When reading educational academic reports, one should note well that the outcomes of such research are seldom transferrable. We hope that this report enables the reader to apply transferable techniques in order to better their provision of assessment feedback to the benefit of their learners.
