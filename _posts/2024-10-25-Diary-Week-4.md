In our fourth week, we have been asked to write a reflective piece. In which, we have to evaluate our current skills in three areas:


- Skills which help you **do** your research
- Skills which help you **develop** your research
- Skills which help you **disseminate** your research


Filling in this form was more difficult than I had first anticipated. Aspects around career development were not difficult, since I have some experience in a professional setting - particularly as a teacher. It got me thinking about how important it is to reflect for one's development and self-confidence. Being successful does not automatically transfer to different areas. However, you can certainly squeeze all you can out of times when you have been successful. Though one's failures are an even better teacher, we tend to develop mind blocks when we focus on past failures. I used to say this to my GCSE-resit students: If you reflect on moments of your life when you have been successful, or focus on something that made you proud, have faith that the perseverance which led to that success can be applied to maths (or anything else that you're feeling unsure of yourself about).

Easier said than done, but positivity breeds positivity. It doesn't have to be fake, just think about the struggles that you have overcome and you will have a better view of upcoming challenges.

One of my favourite examples of reflection at the moment is Xzibit's new single. He details the struggles of his life and what it means to him to have overcome them. Definitely worth a listen:
