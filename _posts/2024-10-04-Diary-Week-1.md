My first week as a PhD student was an interesting one; learning how to manage my time without strict boundaries in place has been a learning curve. My background as a mathematics teacher and foundation year lecturer has trained me to be somewhat rigid with my time, whether that be via explicit teaching timetables and 1:1 meetings or self-imposed _I need to get this task done to get it out of my mind_-type restrictions. However, as a PhD student, I need to retain information long-term. Therefore, I resorted to old behaviours and created a timetable, briefly describing my various commitments and allocating a sensible amount of time to study.


This is of course adaptable and subject to change, though an outline of a timetable forces me to focus on certain tasks as and when I need to. I would highly recommend that every student creates a timetable to support their studies. I have provided links to various time management resources that I like below. Feel free to check them out.:

* Creating a timetable using Microsoft Excel. Excel is my favourite tool to use when creating a timetable. Plus, there are tonnes of templates available to you on their [website](https://create.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/schedules).
* Pomodoro technique. This is always a go-to on many time management suggestion lists. Basically, you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break. repeat this 4 times and then take a longer break. The duration of each working period and break is entirely up to you. Here is an [article which better describes the process](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique). If you like the sound of this technique, here is a [neat timer that helps you count each period](https://pomofocus.io/). It seems Italian tomatoes are better for you in more ways than first expected!
