I have no prior experience with HTML. Yet, I wanted to create a (debateably) nice-looking homepage to my site.

I started by creating flip cards, as I have always enjoyed cursor interactivity on websites. I think that it adds something unique to the site's user interface. To do this, I went straight to Google. There are some great resources on [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), particularly their [guide on how to create flip cards using HTML and CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp). W3 Schools made it super simple to implement into my GitHub pages site. 

From there, I wanted to create custom cards. Being a big fan of PowerPoint for graphic design, I used Office 365 to create the cards:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <div style="flex: 25%; padding: 5px;">
    <img src="/assets/card_doe_front.png" alt="Figure 1" style="width: 100%;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 25%; padding: 5px;">
    <img src="/assets/card_net_front.png" alt="Figure 2" style="width: 100%;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 25%; padding: 5px;">
    <img src="/assets/card_py_front.png" alt="Figure 3" style="width: 100%;">
  </div>
  <div style="flex: 25%; padding: 5px;">
    <img src="/assets/card_diary_front.png" alt="Figure 4" style="width: 100%;">
  </div>
</div>


Then, created the back of the cards as you see in the first image. Following the guidance from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp), CSS was added to ensure that the images fit and that the cursor-interactivity worked. 

The rest of the week was filled with studying and induction activities. I also obtained a copy of [Statistical Principles for the Design of Experiments](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/statistical-principles-for-the-design-of-experiments) by Mead, Gilmour and Mead from the Brunel library. One thing I can confidently say is that it helps to have different perspectives one studying the same topic. It very much helps to being things together clearly in your mind.

I also read Chapters 2 - 5 of [Design and Analysis of Experiments](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Design+and+Analysis+of+Experiments%2C+10th+Edition-p-9781119492443) by [Douglas Montgomery](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5PboKNAAAAAJ&inst=18254509834311452328). It has provided an excellent overview of the basics of experimental design in an easy-to-follow way. 

Overall, I am really enjoying my time here. If you're currently doing a PhD or MA / MSc thesis, remember to search for different perspectives on the same topic. It sounds obvious but reading two sources describing the same idea helps to deepen your understanding of a topic.
