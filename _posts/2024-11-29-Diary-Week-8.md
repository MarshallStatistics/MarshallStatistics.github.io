This week, I decided to create a section for notes on experimental design. As mentioned previously, I do not have a great deal of formal training in statistical theory, so I thought I would start with the basics.

Many of the additive models in experimental design rely on an understanding of regression. As such, I started to create notes on regression where I introduce where the design matrix comes from. Though I have aimed these notes at a wider audience, they are mostly for me as a repository for what I have learned.

I forgot how powerful this can be as a tool for knowledge retention. As a teacher, I normally encourage students to work in groups if I want them to tackle a complex problem. This two-way communication between students can benefit all those involved: The ones that struggle can ask questions to those that are more knowledgeable and the more knowledgeable students can teach others. 

As a student, I now realise the power that teaching can have on understanding a topic. You can check where you have gone wrong and what you are yet to learn. This is a much more powerful approach to note taking; I would strongly encourage all new PhD students to lay out their notes as if they are teaching it in a logical manner.

It certainly works for me!
