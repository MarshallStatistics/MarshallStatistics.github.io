Your university's library is a great resource. [Brunel's library](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/life/library) is fantastic! However, what if a book is unavailable in your institution's library? In this week's diary post, I would like to share with you some good websites for finding second-hand books (for those based in the UK)!

- [AbeBooks](https://www.abebooks.co.uk/) aggregates multiple book sellers to provide the best price for used books - highly recommend this.
- [eBay.co.uk](https://www.ebay.co.uk/) is always a good place to look for independent sellers that are selling books that they no longer need.
- [WorldofBooks.com](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb?msclkid=e3c8376813e61dfb5b20505324de2bb9&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Wob%20-%20GBR%20-%20Bing%20-%20Search%20-%20GOR%20-%20EN%20-%20Generic%20-%20Second%20Hand&utm_term=second%20hand%20books&utm_content=Second%20Hand%20Books%20(Exact)) is another good site, similar to AbeBooks.
- Alternatively, you may find what you are looking for in charity shops, particularly those situated near universities and in university towns.
