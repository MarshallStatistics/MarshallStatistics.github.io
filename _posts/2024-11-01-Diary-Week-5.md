At Brunel, we are required to have a review just four weeks into the process. This is an opportunity to properly plan ahead (if one hasn't done so already) and take stock on what has been learned so far.

As part of this process, we are asked to produce a review document. This document should somewhat resemble a literature review and should guide the reader on the basics of your research field. Please see mine below.
